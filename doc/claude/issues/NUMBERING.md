# Issue number reservations — read before filing

Two blocks are reserved for other branches. Filing into them collides with work
this branch cannot see, and the 02xx renumbering recorded in `status.md` is what
that costs to undo.

| block | owner | rule |
|---|---|---|
| **0500–0599** | the fluid-editing branch | after **0499**, the next number is **0600** |
| **0700–0799** | reserved (user, 2026-08-24) | after **0699**, the next number is **0800** |

So the filing sequence is:

```
… 0498  0499  0600  0601 …  0698  0699  0800  0801 …
```

Highest filed on `annotate` as of 2026-08-25: **0698** (0668-0673 filed by the
0663 crew; 0674-0677 by the 0664+0665+0666 crew; 0681 by the 0678 crew; 0679/0680
by concurrent crews; 0683-0684 by the 0682 crew; 0685-0690 by the 0683+0684 crew;
0691-0692 by the 0679 crew; 0693-0696 by the 0691+0692 crew; **0697-0698 by the
0695+0696 crew**). The next number is **0699** — and after 0699 it is **0800**.

`status.md` covers the fluid-editing branch and its 02xx numbering.
`status_annotate.md` covers this branch, 0600–0698. They do not share a number
space.
