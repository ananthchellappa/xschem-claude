# rdw.tcl -- the Results Display Window (RDW).
#
# Item B3 of doc/claude/op_param_batch/PLAN.md, feature 1245.
# Spec: doc/claude/specs/op_param_lists.md sections 4.2 (B1/B2/B3/B7) and
# 5.1 (Q6, Q10).  Rulings: doc/claude/op_param_batch/DECISIONS.md D-3, D-4,
# D-5 and driver decision DD-1.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHY THIS WINDOW EXISTS, IN THE USER'S OWN WORDS
# ============================================================================
# The text must be SELECTABLE and COPYABLE so it can be pasted into
# design-review documents.  That is not a nice-to-have; it is the reason this
# is a window and not a line in the CIW.  So the pane is a real Tk text with
# a real selection, `-exportselection 1` so the X PRIMARY selection and
# Ctrl-C both work, and `-state disabled` so nobody can type into a record of
# a simulation.
#
# NOT `textwindow` (xschem.tcl:13567).  That proc takes a FILENAME, opens an
# EDITABLE widget, and its Save writes back to that file -- building on it
# would offer to save a results dump over one of the user's design files.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS WINDOW SAYS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# ============================================================================
# It says what THIS run's currently selected raw slot actually holds and
# actually computed for exactly this device path, which primitive each number
# belongs to, which columns the simulator did not compute, which ones came
# back non-finite, THAT THE LIST IS NOT EVERYTHING THE DEVICE HAS, and -- when
# there is nothing -- WHICH of the five silences this is.
#
# It does NOT say that the run converged.  An empty `nonfinite` bucket is not
# proof: the same NaN in an ASCII raw arrives as a finite 0 and lands in
# `devices` (src/save.c, deliberate; issue 1272 is still open).  No sentence
# below claims convergence.
#
# ============================================================================
# THE SEAM'S ANSWER IS FIVE KEYS (ase::backend_hook <sim> op_param_set)
# ============================================================================
#   devices   ordered {<rawdev> {{<param> <value>} ...}}, raw-file order,
#             one entry per PRIMITIVE the request covers
#   absent    ordered {<rawdev> <param>} -- columns the raw NAMES and the
#             simulator did not compute
#   nonfinite ordered {<rawdev> <param> <text>} -- columns the raw DOES carry,
#             holding Inf/NaN: a device that did not converge
#   complete  the honesty flag AS DATA (0 for today's ngspice)
#   state     no_devpath | no_raw | not_op | not_annotated | ok
#
# ⚠ THE SHARPEST TRAP, MEASURED AND NOT INFERRED: a real device can appear in
# NO `devices` entry at all.  An all-dims=0 device answers
#     devices {} absent {{@m.x1.m9 id} {@m.x1.m9 vth}} state ok
# and a binary raw with NaN/Inf answers
#     devices {} nonfinite {{@m.x1.m8 id nan} {@m.x1.m8 vth inf}} state ok
# A renderer that walks `dict keys [dict get $ans devices]` prints an EMPTY
# dump for a real, named, non-converged device.  So the row set is the UNION
# of the rawdev names in all THREE buckets -- rdw::_rowdevs, below.
#
# ============================================================================
# THE THREE RENDERING OBLIGATIONS, ALL RULED, NONE OPTIONAL
# ============================================================================
# 1. `complete` 0 MUST BE VISIBLE (DD-1's corollary).  Key 3's answer is
#    incomplete BY CONSTRUCTION today, and a caller that renders the pairs
#    silently reads as a COMPLETE list -- the failure D-4 exists to prevent.
# 2. `nonfinite` renders "(did not converge)", never a blank and never the raw
#    `nan`/`inf` text.  A non-converged operating point is a RESULT a designer
#    wants told, not a gap.  Invariant I3 forbids the raw text.
# 3. The four non-`ok` states are FOUR DIFFERENT SENTENCES, and `ok` with an
#    empty union is a FIFTH.  `not_op` in particular means the user is looking
#    at a transient: say so, and say what to do.  None of them says
#    "nothing found".
#
# ============================================================================
# THREE LAYERS, SO THE RENDERER IS TESTABLE WITH NO Tk AT ALL
# ============================================================================
#   pure      _cadence_path  _rowdevs  _incomplete_line  _nonfinite_text
#             _state_sentence  format_answer  block_text  button_state
#   context   header  sim  dump  dump_devpath  push  status   (xschem/op_annot,
#             still no Tk)
#   Tk        have_tk  open  close  build  render_pane  set_list  inert
#             palette  color
#
# ⚠ SURVIVING --nogui BY NOT BEING CONSTRUCTED.  This file is reached by the
# UNGUARDED bare `source` block in xschem.tcl, so a single Tk command executed
# at SOURCE time aborts startup (issue 0663's mechanism).  Nothing below runs
# at source time but `namespace eval` and `proc`; every Tk command sits inside
# a proc behind rdw::have_tk.
#
# ⚠ THE BUTTONS ARE INERT IN THIS ITEM.  B3 ships the column, the greying and
# a test-drivable path to each button.  Item B5 wires them to the store and
# ships the two scope dialogs.  This file calls the list store not at all.
#
# Suite: tests/headless/test_rdw_window_1245.tcl (both arms).

namespace eval rdw {
    # THE STORE.  A list of blocks, NEWEST FIRST.  The pane is a projection of
    # this and never the other way round, which is what makes every renderer
    # row drivable under --nogui.
    variable blocks {}

    # Which list the button column is greying for: annotation | summary | all.
    # Spec 4.2 B7 greys per list; item B4 owns the keys that select one and

}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The live-Tk predicate.  Shape copied from simconf_have_tk (xschem.tcl:4009),
# NOT called across the namespace boundary.  The second half is not
# decoration: under --nogui `winfo` really is an undefined command, so
# `[info exists ::has_x]` alone would still raise.

    return [expr {[info exists ::has_x] && [llength [info commands winfo]] > 0}]
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PURE LAYER.  No Tk, no `xschem`, no backend: hand it a dict, get lines.

# Q6's already-taken default spelling.  The user asked for
# `M2B:/xdut/xbg/xamp1`; the tree has three spellings and none is that one, so
# this mints it from `xschem get sch_path`, whose measured shape carries BOTH
# a leading and a trailing dot (`.xdut.xbg.xamp1.`).  At the top sheet
# sch_path is `.` and the trim yields the empty string, so the header
# degenerates to `M1:/` -- the path stays rooted and the header's shape stays
# constant with depth, so two pastes from different sheets still align.
#
# `sim_sch_path` is deliberately NOT used: it strips every level above the
# point the raw was loaded at, so the header would stop matching the schematic
# the user is looking at.
proc rdw::_cadence_path {schpath} {
    return "/[string map {. /} [string trim $schpath .]]"
}

# THE UNION.  See the trap block at the top of this file: `devices` alone is
# not the row set, because a device whose every column is absent, or whose
# every column is non-finite, has no `devices` entry at all and is still a
# real device the user is looking at.  First-appearance order across
# devices -> absent -> nonfinite, raw-file order within each.

# hands `complete` over as DATA, and a window that renders the pairs without
# it reads as a complete list.  Printed only in state `ok` with a non-empty
